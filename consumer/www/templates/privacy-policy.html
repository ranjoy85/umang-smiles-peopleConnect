			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You use TripPal services, you trust us
			with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you
			understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do
			with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it
			carefully. And remember, you can find controls to manage your
			information and protect your privacy and security at My
			Account.<BR><BR>There are many different ways you can use our
			services – to search for and share information, to communicate with
			other people or to create new content. When you share information
			with us, for example by creating a TripPal Account, we can make those
			services even better – to show you more relevant search results and
			ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others
			quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear
			how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect
			your privacy.<BR><BR><B>Information we collect</B><BR><BR>We collect
			information to provide better services to all of our users – from
			figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more
			complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people
			who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might
			like.<BR><BR>We collect information in the following
			ways:<BR><BR>Information you give us. For example, many of our
			services require you to sign up for a TripPal Account. When you do,
			we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address,
			telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you
			want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we
			might also ask you to create a publicly visible TripPal Profile,
			which may include your name and photo.<BR><BR>Information we get from
			your use of our services. We collect information about the services
			that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that
			uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and
			content. This information includes:<BR><BR><B>Device information</B><BR><BR>We
			collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model,
			operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile
			network information including phone number). TripPal may associate
			your device identifiers or phone number with your TripPal
			Account.<BR><BR><B>Log information</B><BR><BR>When you use our
			services or view content provided by TripPal, we automatically
			collect and store certain information in server logs. This
			includes:<BR><BR>- details of how you used our service, such as your
			search queries.<BR>- telephony log information like your phone
			number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of
			calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of
			calls.<BR>Internet protocol address.<BR>- device event information
			such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type,
			browser language, the date and time of your request and referral
			URL.<BR>- cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your
			TripPal Account.<BR><BR>
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Location information</B><BR><BR>When
			you use TripPal services, we may collect and process information
			about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine
			location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for
			example, provide TripPal with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi
			access points and cell towers.<BR><BR><B>Unique application
			numbers<BR></B><BR>Certain services include a unique application
			number. This number and information about your installation (for
			example, the operating system type and application version number)
			may be sent to TripPal when you install or uninstall that service or
			when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for
			automatic updates.<BR><BR><B>Local storage</B><BR><BR>We may collect
			and store information (including personal information) locally on
			your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including
			HTML 5) and application data caches.<BR><BR><B>Cookies and similar
			technologies</B><BR><BR>We and our partners use various technologies
			to collect and store information when you visit a TripPal service,
			and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to
			identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to
			collect and store information when you interact with services we
			offer to our partners, such as advertising services or TripPal
			features that may appear on other sites. <BR>Information we collect
			when you are signed in to TripPal, in addition to information we
			obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your TripPal
			Account. When information is associated with your TripPal Account, we
			treat it as personal information. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><B>How
			we use information we collect</B></FONT><BR><BR>We use the
			information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain,
			protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect TripPal
			and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored
			content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.<BR><BR>We
			may use the name you provide for your TripPal Profile across all of
			the services we offer that require a TripPal Account. In addition, we
			may replace past names associated with your TripPal Account so that
			you are represented consistently across all our services. If other
			users already have your email, or other information that identifies
			you, we may show them your publicly visible TripPal Profile
			information, such as your name and photo.<BR><BR>If you have a
			TripPal Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and
			actions you take on TripPal or on third-party applications connected
			to your TripPal Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and
			comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and
			other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to
			limit sharing or visibility settings in your TripPal Account.<BR><BR>When
			you contact TripPal, we keep a record of your communication to help
			solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address
			to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about
			upcoming changes or improvements.<BR><BR>We use information collected
			from cookies and other technologies, to improve your user experience
			and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your
			language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in
			the language you prefer. When showing you tailored content, we will
			not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with
			sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual
			orientation or health.<BR><BR>Our automated systems analyze your
			content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product
			features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising,
			and spam and malware detection.<BR><BR>We may combine personal
			information from one service with information, including personal
			information, from other TripPal services – for example to make it
			easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine
			DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable
			information unless we have your opt-in consent.<BR><BR>We will ask
			for your consent before using information for a purpose other than
			those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.<BR><BR>TripPal
			processes personal information on our servers in many countries
			around the world. We may process your personal information on a
			server located outside the country where you live.<BR>Information you
			share<BR><BR>Many of our services let you share information with
			others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be
			indexable by search engines, including TripPal. Our services provide
			you with different options on sharing and removing your content.<BR><BR>

			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><B>Accessing
			and updating your personal information</B></FONT><BR><BR>Whenever you
			use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal
			information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways
			to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that
			information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating
			your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity
			before we can act on your request.<BR><BR>We may reject requests that
			are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical
			effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
			changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would
			be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
			information residing on backup systems).<BR><BR>Where we can provide
			information access and correction, we will do so for free, except
			where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain
			our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or
			malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information
			from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from
			our active servers and may not remove information from our backup
			systems.<BR><BR>
